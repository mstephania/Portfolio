* Thesis Title: "Cancer Immunology of Cutaneous Melanoma: A Systems Biology Approach"
* Description: Systems biology help us to investigate the molecular mechanisms of the immune system and could explain the tumour escape, proliferation, and growth in other tissues. I extracted, processed and analysed single-cell data from melanoma patients samples, identifying insights into how tumour cells can evade immune surveillance revealing new and unappreciated links between the immune system and melanoma progression.
